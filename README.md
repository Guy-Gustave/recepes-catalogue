# Recepes Catalogue
> It is a front-end web application, the cornerstone of the react module. I am building a project based on a recipe catalog. This is not an app to help make a recipe because I just want to create a catalog which is a searchable list of items that you can filter and access the details of an item.

## üîß Built With
- CSS
- JavaScript
- React
- Redux
